# Reflection: January 21st

Select an example of a favorite medium or material youâ€™ve used at some point in your life. In line with the ideas of affordance and/or textility, describe the creative processes imposed by your selected medium. Bring an example of the medium to class on Tuesday (photograph, physical sample, etc.)

## Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand    

- When I was in the middle school, we had a science project of making a cell model. Me and my mom melted a candle and poured the liquid into a stainless bowl to make a half-sphere. Since I was making a model of a plant cell, I had to melt a green crayon together with the candle. After the candle liquid had set hard, I separated the solid candle from the bowl and carved the surface, where the components of the cell had to go in. When making the components, I used clay to make shapes and put them into the right spots in the half-sphere.

- For the class, I brought clay as an example of my favorite medium. Clay affords shaping. Depending on the viscocity of clay, we can shape it into different forms. Also, different kinds of clay can be mixed together to create different textures. The textility of clay is special. When you are in the process of making, shaping clay is similar to the act of drawing. Since you are continuously touching it, you can kind of see your finger movement on the surface, and it is also ongoing, work in progress. However, after you bake it, it becomes a finished product, no longer available to change the shape unless you break the object.
