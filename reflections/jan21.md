## Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand    

- The favorite medium I chose is clay. Clay affords shaping. Depeding on the viscocity of clay, we can shape it into different forms. Also, different kinds of clay can be mixed together to create different textures. The textility of clay is special. When you are in the process of making, shaping clay is similar to the act of drawing. Since you are continuously touching it, you can kind of see your finger movement on the surface, and it is also ongoing, work in progress. However, after you bake it, it becomes a finished product, no longer available to change the shape unless you break the object.
