## Creativity 

- I appreciate that Hennessey and Amabile organized a systems view of creativity. Many of the concepts were existed as separate entites in my mind. One of the results that stood out to me was that under certain specific conditions within an organization, negative affect can lead to higher creativity than positive affect. This gives me a more understandable explanation about the lab I was in for my Masters, where the organization had a strict and negative mood but people made a good progress in creative activities.

- I agree with group work can produce bettere results on various measures of creativity, but I also think that the result might be different depending on group arrangements. And the fact that cognitive diversity may be detrimental to team satisfaction, affect, and member's impressions of their own creative performance surprised me. 

- Overall, since I am interested in organizational creativity, it was interesting to read how perceived team leader support can be positively related to the peer-rated creativity of individuals working on creative projects.      


## The Trouble with "Creativity" 

- I think the major argument in this chapter is that creativity is more domain specific than domain general. I believe this argument requires more examination because some creative people like da Vinci and Einstein were both an artist/musician and a scientist. Although many areas have been diverged since then, now many areas are being merged as interdisciplinary research fields.
