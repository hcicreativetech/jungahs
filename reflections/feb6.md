# Reflection: February 6th 

Resnick and Rosenbaum motivate their principles for tinkerability with regards to the opportunities tinkerable systems provide for learning and education. Discuss how tinkering is or is not relevant to professional practice, or expert-level production.

## Designing for Tinkerability 

- As mentioned, Tinkerability is undervalued in many educational settings today. I also felt discouraged when I see some people can think through logical process (planning) and do coding without using debugging tools frequently. After reading this text, my impression toward tinkerability changed. I think that tinkerability can be extended into professional practice. 

- With the aid of tools that allow users to make things with a tinkering approach, people can save time on learning about rules that they need to follow or skills, but can be more focused on finding their own ways to create something. I have used Scratch before, and I thought that some of it's properties could be incorporated into expert-level programming.

- As Bret Victor mentioned in 'Learnable Programming', people understand what they can see. I see this connects to tinkerability. Tinkerability is more intuitive way in which how people make something in real-life. In the beginning when a programming language was invented, I assume that it was highly specialized for programmers. Nowadays since computers are available to most of the people, and anyone can reach to expert-level. As the society involves, I think our programming environment should evolve to more intuitive way based on tinkerability.
