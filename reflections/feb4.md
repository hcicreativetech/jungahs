# Reflection: February 4th 

The assigned readings showcase three strategies for informing the design of technologies: ethnograpy, collaborative making, and autobiographical design. Describe the strengths and limitations of these different strategies as you see them.

## Lessons from the Woodshop: Cultivating Design with Living Materials   

- I think that an 18-month ethnographic study of timber framing at a tiny house contruction program in this paper allowed the authors a deep understanding about the material (wood). Especially for living materials that actively change over time, maybe it is a must to do an ethnographic study like this to fully utilize the advantages and disadvantages of the material. 

- Limitations can be seeking out new tools, procedures, and pedagiges for working with living materials as mentioned. And since the materials change depending on various factors and the environment, it is hard to generalize them and rely on their previous information to make use of them in a different environment.               

## Hybrid Practice in the Kalahari: Design Collaboration through Digital Tools and Hunter-Gatherer Craft 

- Collaborative making creates opportunities to learn from each other and other cultures. Also, as mentioned in the paper, collaborative making can be a form of cross-cultural communication. I think it is a very interesting and creative way to communicate with indigenous societies. 

- Due to collaboration properties, collaborative making can be a two-edged sword. It requires breaking down the barriers of different apporaches. As mentioned in the paper, there existed barriers between abstract and concrete practices when trying to merge digital and non-digital mechanisms.   

## Do-It-Yourself Cellphones: An Investigation into the Possibilities and Limits of High-Tech DIY   

- Mellis and Buechley's autobiographical approach was very interesting. Because they actually made the phone used it in their daily lives, I believe they could well disseminate the cellphone so that other people can also practice DIY. They exactly knew the processes, joy and frustrations coming from the product.  

- However, autobiographical approach can be hard in that it's hard to find the references since it is based on personal experiences. So it would require considerable number of users or workshop studies as they did to get feedback and stable conclusions.
