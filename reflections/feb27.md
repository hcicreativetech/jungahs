## LilyPad in the Wild: How Hardware's Long Tail is Supporting New Engineering and Design Communities 

Based on our discussion of creative practice, describe, from your perspective, the benefits in-the-wild evaluation offers as a way to understand the opportunities and limits of a creative tool or technology? What are the limitations or challenges? Why do you think in-the-wild evaluation is rare in HCI research overall?

- In-the-wild evaluation was very interesting way to evaluate a creative technology. Some of the limitations such as limitations in data were mentioned in the paper. I think this kind of investigation is important if we would like to find out how the technology we created is used by general users. It also gives the idea about influence of the technology on the public awareness. However, it is hard to obtain such a large sample size in statistics unless the tool is manufactured by vendors. Despite some challenges, I do believe that this kind of research having a goal of making room for more diverse interests and passions must be continued.
