# Reflection: January 23rd

Fischer defines four dimensions of social creativity: Spatial, Temporal, Conceptual Within Domains, Conceptual between Domains, and Technological. Thinking back to a collaborative experience you directly participated in, select one of these four dimensions and describe specific barriers or opportunities that you encountered in your personal experience.

## Social creativity: turning barriers into opportunities for collaborative design.  

- I have had an opportunity to work with an artist. Since my background was in engineering, this was an instance of CoI (Communities of Interest). Our task was to find ways for an abstraction of photographs. I As mentioned in Fischer's paper, fundamental challenges were found in building a shared understanding. I had a lack of understanding in photographs and some of the technical methods for processing photographs were unknown to the artist. I had to translate some of the engineering words in a way that the artist can understand. However, after we created common ground and shared understanding, there were also strengths in this collaboration. As I came to understand more about the need of the artist, I was able to seek different kinds of engineering solutions. And I began to feel more confident about the system I was building. This was because of the fact that I was trying to meet someone's needs, not making technology for technology's sake.
