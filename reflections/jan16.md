# Reflection: January 16th 

Reflect on a significant positive learning experience in your life- in school or otherwise. How do the principles presented by Papert on n qualitative experience align with or diverge from your personal experience?

- After I came to MAT, I have had some issues when working with artists or students in humanities. Even though they do logical thinkings in everyday life, some people just have fear about math and formula due to their negative experience. I also have negative experience of dissociated learning, which gave me a bad impression that I am incapable of understanding physics. My problem has been always the connection between formal knowledge and intuitive understanding. I totally agree with Papert's point that scientic knowledge is more similar to knowing a person than similar to knowing a fact or having a skill. I've never seen Turtle, but I thought it would have been quite helpful if the computer allowed me to externalize intuitive expectations.

- If I look back upon the year when I was going to the middle school in US, science was my favorite subject because our teacher allowed us to use procedural thinking effectively and joyfully. Our homework was many times making a real model for what is in the text and through this way, I didn't have to memorize forcefully things that I didn't understand. The reading was very insightful in that the computer can be used as a strategy for doing procedural thinking.
