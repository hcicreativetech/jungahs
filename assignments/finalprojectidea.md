# Final Project Idea

I would like to develop a formal evaluation proposal for an analytical drawing tool that I am planning to design based on 
Kandinskyâ€™s teaching. The target audience will be students who are interested in abstract art and work in digital media. Since 
this project is driven from art theories, I hope to get feedback from artists who work in two-dimensional mediums as well. My 
external design goal is to help users to practice analytical drawing proposed by Kandinsky while my internal design goal is to 
encourage users to see both the evident and the hidden relationships among forms. The participants will use the software to 
draw and I will be collecting information using narrative observation, semi-structured interview and a questionnaire. I would 
like to give out a questionnaire that consists of 10 Likert statements on aesthetics and creativity of the drawings generated 
using the software.
